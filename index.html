                <hr class="hr">
        
                <p class=>In this project, I will be revisiting a topic earlier in the course, prediction snowfall.   This time 
            around I will be attampting to accurately predict the probability of precipitation at 
            Loveland Ski Area 1,3 and 5 days into the future utilizing machine learning algorithms.
                  <br>
                  My hope is to be able to use hyper local data to be able to better predict precipitation, and to
                  ulitmately the odds of snowfall occuring in time to plan for a powder day.

                <h2 >Obtaining Data</h2> 
                <hr class="hr">
        
                <p class=>I examined numerous potential sources of data to train my weather Predicting
                    models.  Based on my anecdotal experience, I suspected that wind (particularly directions)
                    and barometric pressure could play a crucial role in prediction.  
                    Suprisingly, historical baromotric presssure data was exceedingly difficult to find.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Ultimately I decided to turn back to the same source of data I used in my first attempt
                    at snowfall prediction, the Snotel network of automated weather stations.
                    <br><br>
                    I utilized the report generator at https://wcc.sc.egov.usda.gov/reportGenerator/ 
                    to select all snotel stations over an elevation of 7,000 feet above sea level.
                    I created a CSV file of daily precipitation increments from October 1st, 2001
                    Until March 1st 2021 for 504 individual weather stations across the western United States.
                    <br><br>
                    My attempt then became to predict probability of precipitation (ppp) of a specific point based on historical 
                    relationships amongst western US mountain ranges.  (At the target location, Loveland Ski Area, it is to be assumed 
                    precipitation that falls between October and May/June (or possibly another month) will be in the form of sweet Colorado powder, ot atleast heavy spring snow. )
                </p>
                <h2>Data exploration and preparation</h2>
                <p>
                    I began by preparing my target data.  Daily precipitation increments from the target location were offset by 1,3 and 5 days to allow for
                    forecasting and then encoded as a 1 (precipitated) or 0.
                    <img src="images/target.PNG" alt="target">
                    <br>
                    I then merged the snotel precipitation data on date.
                    <br><br>
                    I then created a second dataframe with station metadata, including latitude and longitude and ran the correlation between each stations daily precipitation (or not)
                    and the 1 day offset target result.  
                </p>
                <img src="images/correlation.PNG" alt="station correlation">
                <p>
                    I then used plotly to plot the location of each station, along with correlation represented with color and size. (below visualization is interactive)

                <iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="day1.html" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>
                <p>The highest correlation to a 1 day forecast occur in mainly in Colorado and Utah
                    With such large overlap I then deleted all stations with missing data reducing the set to 209 stations with complete records.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally I merged the closest full automated weatherstation to the target, Soda Creek RAWS station to get additional weather data such as Wind speed, direction, solar radiation, 
                    relative humidity temperature and day of year (for seasonal corrrelation)

                  I ran my feature and target data through numerous models from sci Kit Learn and Tensorflow.
                   as outlined in the below table and summary results:

                        <li>
                            1)Multi Regression Model - This model did of course not yield good results due to the categorical nature of the
                            binary target.  This may be of more help in determining other weather metrics such as temperature.
                         </li>
                        <li>2) KNN Model- this worked fairly well, achieving .71 Accuracy.  It gave the target precipitation probablility.
                            as 29%, accurately predicting no precipitation.
                        </li>
                        <li>3) Descision Tree- This model had predisction accuracy of .626
                        </li>
                        <li>4) Random Forest - This model narrowly beat out K nearest neighbor as highest accuracy at .73.  It correctly predicted no precipitation for the target at an 18% probability</li>
                        <li>5) SVM- slightly lower accuracy at .663</li>

                    After completing my initial look at a 1 day offset forecast I explored the 3 and 5 day data. </p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>3 Day Forecast:</h3>
                    <iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="day3.html" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>  
                    <p>Overall correlations were much lower and more spread out geographically than observed for the 1 day forecast. 
                    <br>
                    Model Performance was also lower than the 1 day forecast.  I ran the random forest algorythym on this data at an accuracy of .636  giving a 21% chance of precipitation   
                      </p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>5 day Forecast</h3>
                    <iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="day5.html" height="525" width="100%"></iframe> 
                    <p> correlations for the 5 day forecast were even lower, though tended to be highest in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California.</p>
                    <p> Model performance slightly worse than 3 day at .61 accuracy.  Model is likely settling in on the overall chance of precipitation and possible seasonality or temperature.</p>

                    Overall performance of the 1 day forecast was reasonable. All of the models correctly predicted no precipitation, some with 
                    high probability.  Logistic regression models appeared to have the best performance.  As a measurement baseline, the percentage of days in the dataset that had precipitation 
                    was 3205 days out of 7093, or 45% percent of the time.  So one could always predict no precipitation and be correct 55% of the time.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    There are numerous ways to modify this algorythym to provide better accuracy.  Top on the list is 
                    more meaningful and complete raw data, including barometric pressure and wind speed/ direction.  Or to go in a different direction.
                    I could start with data from existing weather models and then lay on hyper local feature data. 

                    <br><br>

                    I could also work more on the existing data- for example the difference in wind direction between 359 and 1 degree is not a meaningful difference. 
                    however taking wind speed and direction and converting them into u and v vectors would potentially help increase accuracy. 
                    Similarly I could make the day of year into a more seasonally representative feature.

                    <br><br>

                    automate data pipeline and publish predictions.
